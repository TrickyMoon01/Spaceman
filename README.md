# Spaceman
![javascript](/images/screenshot.png) 

The game I chose was spaceman. I chose spaceman because it was the easiest one to do out of the other options. This game is played similar to hangman. If you don't know what hangman is, it is a game where you have to try to guess the word by guessing letters one by one. You have a certain amount of tries before you lose. If you guess the word, you win. If you run out of guesses, you lose.
